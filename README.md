One-Click WordPress Installer
By Fotan (www.fotan.net)

=================

A &lt; 20kb file that installs WordPress and it's zillion files, plus sets up your wp-config and downloads plugins and cleans up after itself.  Saves a ton of time.

** USE **
 - Set up your web space, just like always.
 - Create a database.
 - Upload 1-click-wp.php to the folder you want WordPress to live in.
 - Browse to http://www.whateveryourdomainis.com/1-click-wp.php
 - Fill in the form
 - Pick any plugins you want to be installed along with WordPress
 - Hit the Submit button
 - Wait about 10 seconds and fill in the WordPress "Install" screen like normal.




** Versions **

	v1.2.4 (2/8/15)
		- Changed from the .tar.gz version of WordPress to the .zip version
    v1.2.3 (1/23/15)
    - Fixed the WordPress download function.  The original one stopped working with a 302 error.
        Decided to make it a little more simple and just used file_get_contents / file_put_contents
    v1.2.1 (8/5/2014)
		- Added Easy Pie Maintenance Mode plugin to auto-install list
	v1.2 (4/29/2014)
		- Backed out of deleting the license.txt and readme.html files
		- Added some security "stuff" to .htaccess
		- Added DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT to wp-config.php so file editing from Dashboard is disabled
		- Added Simple Custom CSS to install list
		- Added Limit Login Attempts plugin to install list
		- Added an uploads folder to wp-content
	v1.1 (4/4/2014)
		- Setup screen now includes a list of the plugins I always seem to want to
		  install with check boxes.  Just check the box and the latest version of the
		  plugin is downloaded and unzipped in the wp-content/plugins folder.
		- To add more plugins to download and unzip, just copy and paste one of hte
		  ones already there and change the value and text after the input.
		- After unzipping the plugin file, the .zip file is deleted from the server
		- Cleaned up the CSS in the form a little.
	v1.0
		- Downloads the latest, stable version of WordPress
		- Displays a form to fill in DB Host, DB User, DB Password
		- Randomly creates the SALT fields (hidden from view)
		- Randomly creates the DB Prefix, but lets you change it if you want
		- Displays a form to fill in FTP Host, FTP User, FTP Password, SSL?
		  If properly filled in, you will be able to use one touch installs and updates
		- Displays a form to set a Memory Limit
		- Deletes the tar ball of the install package
		- Deletes license.txt, because it's silly to have
		- Deletes readme.html, because it's silly to have
		- Creates .htaccess file and makes it writable to the user (664)
		- Forwards to instal.php
